These are some features that may be added (in no particular order):

* A setting to control the motor speed (also via Home Assistant)
* A switch to disable that the motor stops for passengers
* Separate the light switch from the "animations enabled switch"
* When there is a separate light switch, make it possible to change the color
* Additional animations (e.g. like shooting stars or "waving" colors)
* Control a separate light strip with brightness
* Automatically calculate the maximum necessary size for AnimationBuffer
* Save all settings in NVS
